## Couchbase Lite Database Viewer

#### Goal
It is often necessary to see how data is saving while developing and debugging. The aim of this project is to make it easier to view a Couchbase Lite database's contents on the debugging machine, even if the physical location of the database is on a remove mobile device.

#### Roadmap to Alpha

The main goals for alpha are arriving at the bare minimum of functionality with very little polish on the UI

- Get the desktop viewer working for local databases on UWP
- Get the desktop viewer working for local databases on Mac
- Add services to extend beyond local database so that remote access is enabled
   - SSH/SCP client for pull from remote machine file system
   - TCP client for push directly from remote device on update
- Add mobile remove viewer optimized for smaller screen sizes

#### Roadmap to Beta

The main goals for beta are taking the working concepts from alpha, organizing them and introducing extension points for further work.

- Work TBD after working MVP/Alpha complete

#### Roadmap to 1.0
Icons, beautification, documentation etc
